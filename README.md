# AnswerJS

In the fast paced world of javascript, where everything moves faster then you can comprehend, this is what you need. It's easier to reason about, better to use and will lead the way into the future. Features: unbelievably useful, thought provoking, web scalable as well as high performance and real-time. Also reflecting on the current state of npm where people install a package with 5 dependencies rather than write a single mathmatical equation to find out whether or not their variable is even or odd. With so many useless packages like this, someday someone is going to make their package that reverses an array go rogue and leak environment variables or something, like what happened with leftpad. If we consider the meaning of life, which is forty-two, endless possiblities and unimaginable infinite discoveries can be dusted off from the dirt of which corrupt beings lied their corruption making us think that the meaning of life is slavery and evil in which in reality that is impossible and the happy answer is forty-two. In which there was once void, and we tread in their tracks. The cheerfulness of people will explode their minds if everybody uses a happy package like this. This is a package to reflect on the meaning of life.
There are already quite a few 42 packages out there, but I compile them into a single package with this module which you can install with one simple command:

```bash
$ npm install answerjs
```

And, bam!

You now have access to some awesome 42 libraries!
